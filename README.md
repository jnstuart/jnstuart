## About me

:wave: Hi, I'm Julie, a UX Researcher at GitHub working on Codespaces.

My journey into programming began back in the days of Myspace when I spent my summer days tweaking every part of my profile. In college, I discovered my love of psychology and became curious about the space where psychology & technology meet. I found my way back to programming when studying UX in graduate school. Years later, I'm excited that I get to combine my love of developer tooling & psychology as a UX Researcher at GitHub.

In addition to my work on Codespaces, I've had the pleasure of working on Actions, Security, OSS communities, and our new user experience. I'm excited to continue to build the best development and collaboration tool for developers!
